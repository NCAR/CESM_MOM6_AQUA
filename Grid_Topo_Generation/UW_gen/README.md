In this folder are the files that we at UW have been using to create topography and grids for MOM6 aquaplanet simulations.

To create new topography, edit the make_ocean_atmos_grids.py file.
There is an example of a file that will create the RIDGE case called make_ocean_atmos_grids_RIDGE.py

Then, to create the grids, run the file generate_grids.sh from the command line.
